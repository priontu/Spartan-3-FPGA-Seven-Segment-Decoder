# Spartan-3-FPGA-Seven-Segment-Decoder
Used VHDL to program the Seven-Segment Display of the Spartan-3 FPGA board so that the leftmost display showed the hexadecimal value of the binary input provided by the leftmost 4 switches, the second leftmost display showed the hex for the input from the last 4 switches, and the next two displays showed the hex value of the sum of the two leftmost displays. Developed a clock divider and segment decoder, and put it together with a top design to execute the display decoder.
